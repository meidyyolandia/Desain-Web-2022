	<h1>PTIK FKIP UNS</h1>
	<p>The <mark>Faculty of Teacher Training and Education</mark>, <mark>Sebelas Maret University</mark>, Surakarta is an <mark>Educational Personnel Education Institution (LPTK)</mark> which has 24 study programs in 6 majors. Each study program has its own characteristics in producing <mark>superior, strong and intelligent educational staff</mark>.</p>

	<p>The <mark>Informatics and Computer Technology Education (PTIK)</mark> study program is planned to take shelter in the management of the <mark>Engineering and Vocational Education (PTK)</mark> department. This placement revises our previous statement, where the PTIK study program is under the P.MIPA department. PTIK is a study program that will produce graduates who are <mark>prioritized to teach in vocational / vocational programs</mark>. So, it would be better if PTIK was under the PTK department which oversees vocational progroms such as <mark>Building Engineering Education</mark>, and <mark>Mechanical Engineering Education</mark>. To meet the needs of lecturers in the field of information technology that cannot be met by the PTK department, PTIK will conduct <mark>resource sharing with the mathematics study program</mark>.</p>
